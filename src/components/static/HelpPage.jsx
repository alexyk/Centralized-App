            <p>Q: How is LockTrip different than existing booking platforms?</p>
            <p>A: Existing  platforms  (e.g.  Booking.com,  Airbnb.com,  Expedia.com)  are  centralized  and  charge  substantial fees from the property owner and/or the end customer. Additional middlemen are the payment  processors.  All  listings  and  deal  parameters  on  LockTrip  will  be  decentralized  on  the  Ethereum blockchain VM, eliminating all middlemen and guaranteeing transparent execution via smart contracts.</p>
